Torcedores Anônimos is a fun and welcoming web application for soccer fans who are suffering due to their team’s poor performance. Users can chat with our fictional therapist — Dr. Lora Sofrência — for 20 minutes for free. After that, to keep venting, they can subscribe to a symbolic weekly plan.

The site features:

Chat with automatic responses and funny phrases.

Free time countdown.

Deflating ball animation when time runs out.

Modern and responsive interface.

Technologies used: Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, React Hooks.
